## About the Project

This project was developed independently as a technical challenge and operational solution for TireWorldâ€”a company with several locations managing large volumes of tire inventory. The goal was to replace outdated tracking methods with a centralized, scalable system that supports multiple warehouses, reduces errors, and enhances operational efficiency.

*The project is still in active development.*
